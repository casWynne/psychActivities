      <h2>Shape your future from day one</h2>
      <p>Unlike most psychology degrees, at Leeds Trinity you can <strong>specialise from your very first year</strong>, choosing a pathway that reflects your passions and career goals. Whether you’re drawn to mental health, education, crime, health, business, or sport, your pathway runs throughout your degree - allowing you to explore what inspires you while still gaining a full <strong>BPS-accredited Psychology foundation</strong>.</p>
      <p>Alongside core psychological science, you’ll explore real-world issues through applied projects, research, and professional skills development - preparing you for postgraduate training or a career where psychology makes a difference.</p>
      <p>By completing the required number of credits in your chosen area, you’ll <strong>graduate with your pathway named on your degree certificate</strong>, highlighting your specialist expertise.</p>
      <p>Whether you arrive knowing exactly where you want to go, or you’re still exploring your options, this degree adapts to you. You might follow a single pathway from start to finish as <em>The Specialist</em>, mix and match your interests as <em>The Explorer</em>, or begin in one area and evolve into another as <em>The Pathfinder</em>. However you approach it, your Psychology degree will reflect your journey — and the future you want to build.</p>
