    <h1>Morpheme Madness</h1>
    <p>Morphemes are integral to the psychological processes involved in language acquisition, cognitive development,
      literacy, and effective communication. Studying morphemes provides valuable insights into how we understand,
      process, and produce language, which is essential for both psychology and education. A morpheme is the smallest
      meaningful unit in a language. Morphemes can be whole words (like "book" or "run") or parts of words (like
      prefixes and suffixes). They are the building blocks of words, carrying semantic meaning or grammatical function.
      There are 4 types of morphemes described below. Why not try and sort the different morphemes into their
      categories.</p>

  <section class="task-description">
    <p><strong>Lexical:</strong> Content words that convey concrete meanings. They represent objects, actions,
      qualities, and concepts. <em>For example: book, run, good, fun</em></p>
    <p><strong>Functional:</strong> Grammatical words that have little lexical meaning but serve to express grammatical
      relationships between other words. <em>For example: the, and, she, on</em></p>
    <p><strong>Derivational:</strong> Affixes (prefixes or suffixes) added to root words to create new words. They alter
      the meaning or part of speech of a word.</p>
    <p><em>For example: adding "un-" to the start of "happy", changes meaning of the root word. Adding the suffix
        "-ness" to "happy" changes adjective "happy" to noun "happiness".</em></p>
    <p><strong>Inflectional:</strong> Modifies a word's tense, number, aspect, mood, or possession without changing its
      core meaning or grammatical category. They adjust words to fit grammatical context.</p>
    <p><em>For example: adding "-s" to make a plural ("books"), adding "-ed" to make something past tense: "talked"
        (past tense of "talk").</em></p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Try to sort the morphemes on the left hand side into the right morpheme category
      on the right. If you get it right the border of the morpheme will turn green. </p>
