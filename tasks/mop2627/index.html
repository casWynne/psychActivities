    <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
    <p>
      From Academic Year 2627 onwards, Psychology students will choose modules across three levels:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 module in Year 1 (Level 4)</li>
      <li>2 modules in Year 2 (Level 5)</li>
      <li>3 modules in Year 3 (Level 6)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your selected modules will determine your graduation pathway. Choose a focused set for a specialist pathway, or
      mix broadly for a General Psychology award.
