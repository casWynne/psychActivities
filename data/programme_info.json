Next, we turn to look at how broader psychological factors such as metacognition influence the way children and adults engage with education. Our journey through these areas is embedded in developing our knowledge, practice, and application of reflective practice -  a key skill for all practitioners. You'll apply psychological theory, research, and legislation to case study scenarios, allowing you to identify strategies to support children and young people and enhance the practices of those working alongside them."

Throughout the module you will get the chance to put yourself in the shoes of an educational psychologist, drawing on psychological ideas and new research to suggest strategies to support those in education settings. You’ll also get to meet members of our wider psychology team, learning how they apply their specialist knowledge areas to supporting children’s development in a variety of contexts."
